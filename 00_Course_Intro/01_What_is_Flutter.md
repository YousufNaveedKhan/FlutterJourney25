# What is Flutter?

Flutter is an **open-source UI framework by Google** used to build
**mobile, web, and desktop applications** using a **single codebase**.

Simply:
> Write code once, run it on multiple platforms.

## Why Flutter?

- Fast development
- Single codebase
- Beautiful and flexible UI
- Strong community support
- Used by real companies in production

## Flutter’s Core Idea

Flutter works on **widgets**.

Everything you see on the screen is a widget:
- Text
- Button
- Image
- Even the whole screen

Example:
```dart
Text("Hello Flutter")
````

This is also a widget.

## How Flutter Thinks

Flutter does not focus on screens.
It focuses on **UI + State**.

If you understand:

* How UI is built
* How state changes

Flutter becomes easy.

## Important Note for Students

> Learning Flutter is not about memorizing widgets.
> It is about **thinking in UI and controlling state logically**.

In this course:

* We build basics slowly
* We practice a lot
* We move step by step towards real apps
